## 🚀 Introduction  
Welcome to **Text Analysis Tool**! 🎉  
This project is a text analysis tool that allows you to perform various operations such as character and word analysis, word counting, text reversal, and word ordering using different data structures. And the best part? It comes with an **interactive graphical interface** using **Pygame**! 😍  

## 🎯 Features  
🔹 **Character Analysis**: Extracts the frequency of each character while ignoring insignificant ones.  
🔹 **Word Analysis**: Counts the occurrence of unique words and displays them in descending order.  
🔹 **Reverse Text using Stack**: Reverses text efficiently using the stack data structure.  
🔹 **Word Ordering using Queue**: Maintains word order as entered using the queue data structure.  
🔹 **Word Count**: Simply counts the total number of words in the text.  
🔹 **Graphical Interface**: User-friendly interface with input fields, buttons, and result display areas.  

## 🛠 Implementation Details  
✔ **Character Analysis**: Uses a dictionary to count occurrences and sorts results by frequency.  
✔ **Word Analysis**: Splits text into words, stores them in a set, and counts their occurrences.  
✔ **Reverse Text (Stack)**: Implements a stack using a list and reverses text using \`append()\` and \`pop()\`.  
✔ **Word Ordering (Queue)**: Implements a queue using a list and maintains order with \`append()\` and \`pop(0)\`.  
✔ **Word Count**: Splits text into words and counts them using \`len()\`.  
✔ **Graphical Interface (GUI)**: Designed using **Pygame** with an input box, buttons, and result display area.  

## 💡 Challenges Faced  
⚡ **Choosing the right data structures**: Selecting the appropriate structure (dictionary, list, queue, stack) for each task.  
⚡ **Handling empty or invalid inputs**: Implemented validation checks to ensure proper input.  
⚡ **Learning Pygame**: Overcame the learning curve of designing an interactive GUI with buttons and input handling.  

## 🎮 How to Run  
1️⃣ Install the required dependencies:  
```bash
pip install pygame
```  
2️⃣ Run the Program:  
```bash
python text_analysis_program.py
```
Or Run the GUI :
``` bash
python text_analysis_gui.py
```
## 📌 Future Enhancements  
🔹 Add support for additional text analysis features.  
🔹 Improve the GUI with more customization options.  
🔹 Optimize performance for handling large texts.  

✨ Enjoy using **Text Analysis Tool**! 🚀
